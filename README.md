SecureCloudNet is a personal lab where I experiment with how networks and security concepts come together. It’s a space to explore how devices communicate, how services are exposed, and how scripting can be used to automate discovery and analysis.

This project highlights small, focused examples—such as building lightweight scanners, setting up controlled environments with containers, and observing how different services respond to connections. Each experiment is designed to make complex ideas approachable and to show how networking and security are inseparable in practice.

The goal is not only to build technical skills but also to share practical demonstrations that others can follow. SecureCloudNet is intended to grow as a collection of scripts, lab notes, and experiments that reflect an ongoing curiosity about how modern infrastructure operates and how it can be safeguarded.
